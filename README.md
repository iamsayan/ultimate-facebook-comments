## Description

### Ultimate Social Comments: the Ultimate Social Comments plugin for WordPress.

If youâ€™re running a blog of any kind, youâ€™re probably looking to build an online community. You're targeting like-minded people who share the interests highlighted by the content on your site. Itâ€™s a mutually beneficial relationship: Your visitors get information that they consider valuable by visiting your site, and you build an audience.

However, itâ€™s also a great idea to allow your visitors to interact with one another. One of the best ways to do that is with a comments section that allows them to not only leave you feedback on your content but also to interact with each other. Here are some of the benefits you can expect from a comments section.
